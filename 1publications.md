**Emerson Johnston**, "Anticipatory identity control: Upstream governance on digital platforms" *Dialogues of Digital Society*, vol. 1, no. 3, September 2025. [Read here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/29768640251377164)

> *This commentary examines the entrenchment of authoritarian governance through the algorithmic architectures of major digital platforms. As identity formation increasingly occurs in online spaces, the capacity to explore, articulate, and inhabit non-normative or politically inconvenient subjectivities is contingent upon the technical affordances and moderation protocols of the platforms that mediate digital public life. Authoritarian regimes have capitalized on this dependency, embedding ideological control both in content policy and in the infrastructural substrate of platforms themselves. This commentary argues that such infrastructural interventions constitute a form of anticipatory governance: preemptively structuring the field of possible selves to align with state-sanctioned norms. In doing so, they reshape digital identity not as an open-ended process, but as a site of containment, coercion, and control.*

**Emerson Johnston**, "When Regulation Backfires: Cultural Infrastructure and the Mass Migration from TikTok to RedNote." *Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Communities & Technologies (C&T '25)*, July 2025, pp. 28–43. [Read here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3742800.3742827)

> *This paper examines how the 2025 U.S. ban on TikTok triggered an unexpected policy backfire when millions of American users migrated to RedNote (Xiaohongshu), another Chinese-owned platform. Following the Supreme Court’s decision in TikTok Inc. v. Garland, over 4 million U.S. users — primarily digital opinion leaders — deliberately chose RedNote as an act of political protest, creating unprecedented cross-cultural connections that amplified rather than reduced Chinese digital influence.*

**Emerson Johnston** and Amy Zegart, “Policy Implications of the DeepSeek AI Talent Base.” *Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI)*, May 2025. [Read here](https://hai.stanford.edu/policy/policy-implications-of-deepseek-ai-talent-base)

> *A companion piece to the Hoover Institution white paper, this article distills the core policy takeaways for U.S. decision-makers. It emphasizes the strategic relevance of talent development pipelines, the shifting landscape of global AI expertise, and the importance of long-term investment in domestic research ecosystems.*

**Emerson Johnston** and Amy Zegart, “A Deep Peek into DeepSeek AI’s Talent and Implications for US Innovation.” *Technology Policy Accelerator*, Hoover Institution, April 2025. [Read here](https://www.hoover.org/research/deep-peek-deepseek-ais-talent-and-implications-us-innovation)    

> *This white paper investigates the emergence of DeepSeek AI, a Chinese research firm whose rapid advancements in large language models have challenged dominant assumptions about American leadership in frontier AI. In it, we analyze the institutional trajectories and academic records of the over 200 researchers involved in DeepSeek’s foundational work. Our findings reveal a self-sustaining pipeline of highly skilled researchers largely developed within China, with limited long-term reliance on Western institutions. With this in mind, we argue that U.S. policymaking must address not just compute and infrastructure disparities, but the broader erosion of America’s global talent advantage in artificial intelligence.*
