## Interests

**My main research interests include:**

- **Digital Identity and Self-Actualization**  
  How do digital platforms facilitate or constrain identity development? In what ways do online spaces shape the exploration of heritage, belief, or belonging—particularly for individuals who are culturally displaced, diasporic, or otherwise navigating fragmented social contexts?

- **Platform Design, Algorithms, and User Agency**  
How do social media's structural features (recommendation systems, content moderation, interface design, algorithmic curation) shape identity expression, community formation, and user behavior? What kinds of agency, resistance, or informal knowledge do users develop through their everyday encounters with these systems, and how do those practices differ across cultures?

- **Digital Environments and Developmental Infrastructure**  
How do platform economics reshape experiences across different life stages and communities? What happens when children get funneled into age-agnostic platforms, when bounded spaces for marginalized communities erode, or when intimate life becomes a site of labor extraction? What would alternative design principles look like if they centered developmental needs, community boundaries, and human flourishing instead of engagement metrics?

- **Histories of Digital Communication and Technology Adoption**  
What can early internet communities (Usenet forums, bulletin boards, platforms like Club Penguin that were built specifically for kids) teach us about how digital identity, community formation, and tech governance have evolved? How do historical cases of adoption, resistance, and platform migration inform what's happening now with sociotechnical change?

**Outside of research,** 

Outside of research, I love physical problem, solving like rock climbing, escape rooms, and other games that demand strategy and teamwork. I grew up figure skating, and I try to spend as much time as I can on the ice. I also play blues guitar and a little piano, and I sing whenever I get the chance.
