## Research Interests

**My main research interests include:**


- **Digital Identity and Self-Actualization**  
  How do digital platforms facilitate or constrain identity development? In what ways do online spaces shape the exploration of heritage, belief, or belonging—particularly for individuals who are culturally displaced, diasporic, or otherwise navigating fragmented social contexts?

- **Platform Design, Algorithms, and Affiliation**  
  How do the structural features of social media—such as recommendation systems, content moderation protocols, and interface logic—shape patterns of identity expression and collective affiliation? What forms of social behavior are rendered legible, amplified, or suppressed by algorithmic design?

- **Histories of the Internet and Early Online Communities**  
  What can the communicative practices of early internet communities—such as Usenet forums or bulletin board systems—reveal about the evolution of digital identity? How did the technical architectures of early networks influence the way users engaged with health, crisis, or solidarity communication?

- **Histories of Emerging Technologies and Adoption Patterns**  
  What social, political, and institutional factors shape the adoption trajectories of emerging technologies? How do historical cases of adoption, resistance, or repurposing inform our understanding of contemporary tech deployment? What lessons can be drawn from past transitions in communication and computation infrastructures?

**Outside of research,** 

Outside of research, I love physical problem-solving—rock climbing, escape rooms, and games that demand strategy and teamwork. I grew up figure skating, and I still spend as much time as I can on the ice. I also play blues guitar and piano, and I sing whenever I get the chance.
