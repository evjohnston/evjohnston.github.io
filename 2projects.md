## Current Projects

*Here are some collaborative projects I'm working on:*
- Since Winter 2024, I've been collaborating with the [Stanford University Social Media Lab](https://sml.stanford.edu/) to research algorithmic behavior and perception. Our goal is to discern how algorithms and other content recommendation systems affect user engagement and behavior.
- I'm also working with a team of researchers from Stanford University and UC Berkeley to investigate methods for improving online discourses. Our goal is to develop strategies that promote constructive dialogue in polarized environments.
- And, as part of a [Knight-Hennessy Scholars Kheystone Project](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/program-overview/leadership-development/kheystone-projects), I've been working with the [Stanford Literary Lab](https://litlab.stanford.edu/) to investigate computational approaches to literary analysis. Our project examines how technology can be used to study identity in English literature.

*And independently,*
- I've also spent the last two quarters conducting a historical analysis of AIDS discourses on Usenet in the early 1980s. This project originated from a media history course I took in Winter 2024 with Drs. Jennifer Burns and Fred Turner. I continued this research in a social networks course I took with Dr. Daniel McFarland in Spring 2024, where I expanded the project's focus to investigate the impact of influential authors on community dynamics and evolution, and I am still working on it now.
- I've also been working to investigate theoretical models of social interaction, focusing specifically on the application of scientific and technological principles to human behavior.

## Other Ideas

*Here are some questions I've been thinking about, but haven't gotten around to investigating:*
- How does the fragmentation of social media platforms and the diverse behaviors users exhibit across them affect their self-concept? Does it lead to a fragmented sense of self or does it foster a more nuanced and multifaceted identity?
- How are social media users' self-concepts impacted by their most frequent form of shared content, particularly in relation to permanent content versus ephemeral content? 
- How does the rapid propagation of fictitious pop culture phenomena such as [Listenbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listenbourg), [Goncharov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goncharov_(meme)), and [Zepotha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zepotha) through social media platforms impact user trust and wellbeing, and what does it suggest about collective action and memory in digital memetic culture?
