## Current Projects

*Here are some things I'm working on now:*
- I've been working with the Stanford University Social Media Lab to investigate social media dynamics, specifically focused on algorithmic behavior. We aim to understand how these algorithms influence user engagement and content dissemination.
- I'm also working with a team of researchers from Stanford University and the UC Berkeley to investigate methods for improving online discourse. We aims to develop strategies that promote constructive dialogue in polarized environments.
- And as part of a [Knight-Hennessy Scholars Kheystone Project](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/program-overview/leadership-development/kheystone-projects), I've been working with the Stanford Literary Lab to investigate computational approaches to literary analysis. Our project examines how technology can be used to study identity in English literature.

*Independently*, I've spent the last two quarters investigating the impact of influential authors on AIDS discourses on Usenet in the 1980s. This project originated from a media history course I took in Winter 2024 with Drs. Jennifer Burns and Fred Turner. I continued this research in a social networks course with Dr. Daniel McFarland in Spring 2024, and I am still working on it now. I've also working on my own to investigate theoretical models of social interaction. My focus is on the application of scienstific and technological principles to human behavior.

## Idea Dump

Here are some questions I've been thinking about, but haven't gotten around to investigating: 
- How does the fragmentation of social media platforms and the diverse behaviors users exhibit across them affect their sense of self? Does it lead to a fragmented sense of self or does it foster a more nuanced and multifaceted identity?
- How are social media users' self-concepts impacted by their most frequent form of shared content, particularly in relation to permanent content versus ephemeral content? Does the nature of permanent posts lead to a more stable self-identity, while ephemeral content fosters a more dynamic and adaptable sense of self? 
- How does the rapid propagation of fictitious pop culture phenomena such as [Listenbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listenbourg), [Goncharov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goncharov_(meme)), and [Zepotha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zepotha) through social media platforms impact user trust and wellbeing, and what does it suggest about collective action and memory in digital memetic culture?
