## Current Projects

*Here are some things I'm working on now:*
- Since Winter 2024, I've been collaborating with the Stanford University Social Media Lab to research social media dynamics, with a particular emphasis on algorithmic behavior and perception. Our goal is to discern how algorithms and the way the disemminate recommended content affect user engagement and the spread of content.
- I'm also working with a team of researchers from Stanford University and UC Berkeley to investigate methods for improving online discourses. Our goal is to develop strategies that promote constructive dialogue in polarized environments.
- And, as part of a [Knight-Hennessy Scholars Kheystone Project](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/program-overview/leadership-development/kheystone-projects), I've been working with the Stanford Literary Lab to investigate computational approaches to literary analysis. Our project examines how technology can be used to study identity in English literature.

I've also spent the last two quarters conducting a historical analysis of AIDS discourses on Usenet in the early 1980s. This project originated from a media history course I took in Winter 2024 with Drs. Jennifer Burns and Fred Turner. I continued this research in a social networks course I took with Dr. Daniel McFarland in Spring 2024, where I expanded the project's focus to investigate the impact of influential authors on community dynamics and evolution, and I am still working on it now. I've also been working on my own to investigate theoretical models of social interaction, focusing specifically on the application of scientific and technological principles to human behavior.

## Other Ideas

*Here are some questions I've been thinking about, but haven't gotten around to investigating:*
- How does the fragmentation of social media platforms and the diverse behaviors users exhibit across them affect their sense of self? Does it lead to a fragmented sense of self or does it foster a more nuanced and multifaceted identity?
  - *I became interested in this just seeing how differently I acted across different social media platforms. I'm curious if, for someone who's grown up online and splits their time significantly between platforms where their presentation is different (think linkedin and a personal instagram, snapchat and a facebook), this decentralized online engagement might influence their overall sense of identity and self-perception.*
- How are social media users' self-concepts impacted by their most frequent form of shared content, particularly in relation to permanent content versus ephemeral content? Does the nature of permanent posts lead to a more stable self-identity, while ephemeral content fosters a more dynamic and adaptable sense of self?
  - *I became interested in this after seeing friends of mine regularly and irregularly engage with instagram's various posting features. Why do some of my friends primarily use stories, while others primarily use posts? What does this suggest about their sense of self and how does this posting hebavior eventually affect their sense of self?* 
- How does the rapid propagation of fictitious pop culture phenomena such as [Listenbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listenbourg), [Goncharov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goncharov_(meme)), and [Zepotha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zepotha) through social media platforms impact user trust and wellbeing, and what does it suggest about collective action and memory in digital memetic culture?
  - *I became interested in this because I was online and able to follow the live development of both Goncharov (conducted on Tumblr in 2020) and Zepotha (conducted on TikTok in 2023). It's astonishing how quickly full narratives for both hoaxes were developed, but it's the motive behind Zepotha in particular—designed to promote an album—as well as the widespread anxiety all three hoaxes caused that make me want to further investigate the ethical implications of this phenomenon.*
