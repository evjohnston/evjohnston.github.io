Hi! I'm **Emerson Johnston** *(she/her)*, a master's student in International Cyber Policy and Security at Stanford University and a [Knight Hennessy Scholar](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/people/emerson-johnston). I study the relationship between the internet and identity, with a particular focus on the social media use of culturally displaced peoples. Currently, my research uses ethnographic methods, network analysis, and archival research to investigate how social media affect self-actualization and collective identity formation on- and offline. I'm a regular contributor to the [Stanford International Policy Review](https://fsi.stanford.edu/sipr), where I write about the how digital platforms affect geopolitics and modern warfare. I am always open to collaboration, cold emails, and questions.
