## Interests

### My main research interests include:

**\#** **Self-Actualization and Cultural Identification on Social Media:** I'm interested in investigating how digital platforms facilitate self-discovery, foster community affinity, and enable the exploration of various identity facets, including heritage, sexuality, and personal beliefs.

**\#** **Influence of Platform Design and Algorithms on Identity:** I'm interested in exploring the impact of social media platform design, algorithms, and broader internet architectures on shaping user identity and community affiliation.

**\#** **History of the Internet and Early Online Communites:** I'm interested in understanding how the internet and social media have developed over time, with a particular focus on early online communities and the lessons they provide for current digital interactions and identity formation.

Other research fields I'm interested in include quantum social science, digital linguistics, and behavioral economics. I'm also deeply fascinated in exploring how pedagogy can integrate internet studies and digital technologies with the social sciences.

### Outside of research, my interests include:

rockclimbing, figure skating, escape rooms, spanish guitar and singing
