### research

My research interests include:

**\#** **Self-Actualization and Cultural Identification on Social Media:** I'm interested in investigating how digital platforms contribute to self-discovery, community affinity, and the exploration of various aspects of identity such as heritage, sexuality, and personal beliefs. 

**\#** **Influence of Platform Design and Algorithms on Identity:** I'm interested in exploring how the design of social media platforms, their algorithms, and the internet as a whole shape the identity and affinity of users.

**\#** **History of the Internet and Early Online Communites:** I'm interested in understanding how the internet and social media have developed over time, with a particular focus on early online communities and the lessons they provide for current digital interactions and identity formation.
